A tiny plugin to embed a list of recent posts in a page or a post...

== Description ==

Recent Posts Embed is a plugin for Wordpress that allows you to easily place list of recent posts anywhere in your site.
Recent Posts Embed is fully compatible with Wordpress 2.x and plays well with most other plugins.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `recent-posts-embed` directory and its content to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Place the tag `[recent posts]` in your post, and it will be replaced by a list of recent posts. You can also limit the result to the categories you need by specifying their IDs in the tag: `[recent posts = 1,7,15]` or exclude some categories like this: `[recent posts = -2,-4]`.
